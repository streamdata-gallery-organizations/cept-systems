description: CEPT Systems introduces a new way to process information represented
  by text. The CEPT approach is inspired by the latest findings on the way the human
  cortex works. It breaks with traditional methods based on pure word count statistics.
  The CEPT-Retina produces semantic fingerprints of language representing words, documents
  or the information needs of users. Semantic fingerprints help to get more relevant
  search results and classify information more efficiently. The CEPT-Retina also enables
  the making of intelligent decisions based on human-generated text input.
